# This script is executed `on commit` in the `dhcpd.conf` file of the ISC DHCP server. The `on commit` event is triggered
# when the server has made a commitment of a certain lease to a clientÂ¹.
#
# In this specific script, when a lease is committed, the `execute` statement is called with the specified arguments.
# The first argument is the path to the script or program to be executed (`/home/pi/foswvs/api/client`). The following
# arguments are passed to the script:
# the leased IP address in dotted-decimal notation (`binary-to-ascii(10,8,".",leased-address)`),
# the client's MAC address (`binary-to-ascii(16,8,":",substring(hardware,1,6))`),
# and the client's hostname or "-NA-" if no hostname is provided (`pick-first-value(option host-name,"-NA-")`).
